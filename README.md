# picker
Simple Ruby script for printing a random subdirectory. Directories prefixed with two underscore ("__") are prioritized.

My use case: I use this script daily to add something to iTunes. The directories prefixed with __ are albums that I've bought, or that I've somehow decided that I want to add before most other things.

(My iTunes queue currently has almost 300 albums waiting, god bless Bandcamp.com)
